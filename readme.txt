[h1]What Is This?[/h1]

This mod adds a simple skill perk tree to the game.

Wiki guide: https://github.com/ZenarchistCode/ZenModPack/wiki/Zen's-Skills

It's inspired by Terje's Syberia and Skills mods. The main difference with my mod is I wanted a lightweight skills mod which doesn't influence PVP as much.

If you want a proper full-on RPG style experience, check out Terje's mods - if you just want a reason for players to invest in their characters over the long-term and feel a sense of progression without changing core gameplay much, check my mod out.

The skill perks in my mod are mainly basic survival perks - such as getting an extra log from trees, having a longer lasting heat buff, being able to track animals etc.

The perk rewards are fully customizable in the JSON config.

It comes fully translated with stringtables but I used ChatGPT so they might be bad - feel free to repack and modify the text for non-English servers.

I did my best to ensure the code is robust and should be compatible with most mods out there, but no guarantees can be made due to the complexities of multiple mods overriding core vanilla functions.

It's definitely compatible with Expansion and Terje's Medicine mod as I run those on my server currently.

[h1]Installation Instructions:[/h1]

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server folder and add it to your mods list. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys if you're not using a server management tool like OmegaManager which does that automatically.

This mod must be run on both client and server.

I don't think a wipe is technically required to run this mod, but it is recommended as it does affect persistent storage of some minor items like fruit and predator meat for example. It stores all player data in a separate database so it should not cause any major issues if you don't wipe - but if you choose not to wipe, make sure to have a backup of your storage folder just in case it does corrupt something important as an unexpected side-effect.

There is an optional types.xml file in the mod folder for adding some basic items related to skills (EXP boost injector, skill books etc).

NOTE: This mod is not included in my ZenModPack as I figure this is a niche mod not many servers will use. So if you use my modpack, you'll need to add this mod separately.

[h1]Repack & Source Code:[/h1]

You can repack this mod if you like, and do anything else you want with it for that matter. Just keep in mind my future updates won't be applied so make sure to check back for new versions if you notice any bugs. The source code is on my GitHub at www.zenarchist.com

[h1]Buy Me A Coffee:[/h1]

All my mods are free and open source, but it takes an enormous amount of time to put some of these mods together. If I've helped you out, please consider helping me buy my next coffee! I don't expect it, but I very much appreciate it.
